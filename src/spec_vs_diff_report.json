  "summary": "The diff implements global CSS overrides to make Radix Dialog overlays/content and Select/DropdownMenu popups opaque (addressing transparent dropdowns/modals) without touching the read-only `frontend/src/components/ui` path. However, the diff also appears to introduce broader global theme/palette changes and updates to project metadata files, which were not requested.",

    {
      "description": "Broader global color theme/palette changes (new OKLCH palette variables across background/foreground/card/popover/primary/etc.) beyond just fixing popup opacity/readability.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly scoped work to fixing popup/select/dialog background opacity and readability and listed 'Do not add new features beyond fixing popup/select/dialog background opacity and readability.' The diff shows extensive root and dark theme variable changes that look like a general re-theming.",

      "reason": "Not requested by the BuildRequest, which focused on a UI styling issue. These files do not directly implement the popup opacity fix and appear to be ancillary bookkeeping.",
