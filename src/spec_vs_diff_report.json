  "summary": "REQ-60 and REQ-61 appear implemented via MobileNavDrawer opacity/background tweaks, global CSS overrides for Radix Sheet overlay/content (including disabling backdrop-filter), and cache-busting updates (BUILD_ID and SW cache version). REQ-62 (fresh Draft deploy + new preview link) is not evidenced in the diff. Several additional/unrequested changes were made (global dialog overlay styling, service worker registration logic in index.html, and updates to project metadata files).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-62",
      "requirement": "Deploy a fresh Draft build of the app and provide a new shareable preview link (do not reuse the previous draft link).",
      "reason": "No deployment artifacts, CI/CD changes, or preview URL/link are shown in the provided diff summary; code changes alone do not evidence a new Draft deployment or a new preview link.",

        "<file-diff>: no deployment/preview-link related files or outputs shown"

      "description": "Made Dialog and AlertDialog overlays/content fully opaque globally (not limited to the mobile navigation Sheet/drawer).",
      "reason": "REQ-60 targets the mobile hamburger navigation drawer (Sheet) surface and its overlay/backdrop; the diff adds global styles for dialog/alert-dialog overlays and contents as well.",

    {
      "description": "Added/changed service worker registration behavior to include a buildId query parameter and a ?nosw=1 disable switch, plus console logging in index.html.",
      "reason": "REQ-61 only asks to bump BUILD_ID in buildInfo.ts and bump the SW cache version constant in sw.js; modifying SW registration logic and adding a disable parameter is additional behavior not requested.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/index.html"

      "description": "Updated repository metadata/state tracking files (frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json).",
