# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make customer/product option popups (dropdowns/modals) fully opaque and readable instead of transparent.

**Planned changes:**
- Adjust styling for popup/select/dialog surfaces so their backgrounds are opaque and text contrast is readable.
- Apply the fix without editing shadcn/Radix source files under `frontend/src/components/ui` or other immutable frontend paths.

**User-visible outcome:** Customer/product option dropdowns and dialogs appear with solid (non-transparent) backgrounds, improving readability.
